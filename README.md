# Info about Projects

- These projects are considered training projects that have been implemented through other projects, such as exercises, and not for the     
  purpose of taking ownership, because these projects have been taken as an exercise for me so that I can improve my skills in creating
  websites.

- TFE store Project:
          - The project is a store that sells electronic devices (phones and computers).
            Of course, the project is not real, even the video on the home page is made using artificial intelligence.
            The project consists of three pages, the first is the home page, the second is the computers, and the third is the phones.
          - Note: You can browse products through the menu in the header.
            Of course, the plan is in the compressed file.
  
- Deal_With_files and folders:
          - This Project was created in python and using the OS library to deal with files and folders on your computer using exiting commands
            such as deletion or Add-on, which means full control of folders and files.
